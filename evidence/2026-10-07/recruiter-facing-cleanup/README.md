# Recruiter-facing evidence cleanup

Date: 2026-10-07 UTC
Environment: saved multi-repository workspace, local source only.
Scope: approved recruiter-facing wording and links in `README.md`.
Starting state: clean tree on `work`, commit `261b93fea885d3bd95c6698c8e30edafa0aaca7d`.
Branch: `codex/portfolio-evidence-cleanup`.

Reviewed applicable AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and EVIDENCE.md where present,
current source and Git status. Applied only the approved file cleanup.
Reviewed the complete diff. `git diff --check` passed (exit 0).
No code or metadata changes; runtime/API/org tests were not run.
No push, PR, merge, deployment, org operation or remote account mutation.
Publication remains subject to separate approval; standing publication guidance
is overridden by the explicit local-only task.

`git ls-files force-app` and local directory inspection found only `.gitkeep` placeholders, with no configuration files. This does not establish the state of any Salesforce org. Removed the unsupported configuration proof claim.
