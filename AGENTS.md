# Engineering guidance — tradelink-group

Salesforce administration, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud simulation for fictional TradeLink Group.

## Project context

Audit baseline recorded 2026-09-22; reverify before relying on it.

- README documents intended alias tradelink; connectivity is unverified here.
- No tracked files under force-app/main/default were found during the audit.
- The build log contains no completed entries; the eight-sprint scope is
  intended work, not evidence of a completed implementation.

## Working approach

- Read README.md, existing CLAUDE.md, relevant deliverables and any applicable
  nested instructions before editing.
- Inspect Git status and preserve unrelated or untracked work.
- Distinguish documented scenario, repository evidence and verified org state.
- State unknowns explicitly. Never invent completed tests, credentials,
  implementation outcomes or architecture decisions.

## Repository and metadata

- Read packageDirectories and sourceApiVersion from sfdx-project.json.
- Preserve the current package layout and API version unless a change is needed
  and its compatibility has been checked.
- A clean Git tree does not establish synchronization with an org.
- Before retrieval, identify the target org and exact metadata scope, preserve
  local changes and inspect the resulting diff.
- Do not retrieve all metadata automatically before every edit.
- Verify commands and flags with the installed sf CLI help before unfamiliar
  operations. Never suppress errors to make a check appear successful.
- Keep .sf/, .sfdx/, authentication files, tokens and private data out of Git.

## Org operations and authorization

- Use an explicit --target-org for commands that support it.
- Verify the alias maps to the intended org; never substitute sunrise for an
  unavailable project-specific org.
- Read-only inspection and local documentation work may proceed within scope.
- Before deployment, data mutation, destructive scripts or Flow activation,
  present the exact target, scope, validation and recovery approach to Hemayet.
  Obtain authorization unless the current request already explicitly covers
  that operation and target.
- Git commits and pushes do not constitute Salesforce deployment approval.
- Do not expose access tokens or authentication URLs in logs or documentation.

## Implementation and review

- Keep changes small and traceable to a requirement or documented issue.
- For Apex, review bulk behavior, governor limits, sharing, object and field
  access, input validation and failure handling.
- For automation, review entry conditions, repeated execution, fault paths,
  permissions and effects on existing records.
- Use synthetic test data and meaningful assertions for new behavior.
- Never execute seed or purge scripts merely to inspect them.

## Verification and evidence

- For documentation-only changes, review content, links and git diff --check.
- For metadata or code changes, select validation appropriate to the affected
  behavior and confirm current Salesforce requirements for the target.
- Record the test target, command or procedure, result and limitations.
- Treat coverage as one check, not proof of correctness.
- Do not claim Apex tests ran locally when they ran in a Salesforce org.
- Preserve existing evidence; label simulations and proposed work clearly.

## Git and decisions

- Review staged diffs and stage only files belonging to the task.
- Prefer a focused branch and pull request for implementation changes.
- Never force-push, reset or clean away unrelated work.
- Record significant decisions with context, alternatives and consequences.
  Mark proposals as proposed; do not invent accepted decisions or approvers.

## Project evidence in GitHub

Hemayet wants supporting evidence kept in GitHub for every project. Follow
EVIDENCE.md in this repository. For each substantive task, save dated evidence
of the work and its actual verification before reporting completion. Preserve
existing evidence and project-specific conventions. Never invent results.
Review evidence for secrets and personal/customer data before committing.
Commit and push only task-related changes to this project's established remote,
following its branch/PR workflow. Verify the remote commit and include its link
in the completion report. A local file or commit alone is not a GitHub upload.
If access, connectivity, branch protection or a missing remote blocks upload,
retain the evidence locally and report the precise blocker. Do not force-push.
This standing evidence request does not authorize deployment or unrelated work.

## Mission, lab roles and browser rules

Hemayet's goal is to win a first job and a first client. Claude Code (Chief of Staff) and
Codex (Chief of Engineer) work under Hemayet's direction.

- Labs: `salesforce-dev` is for the job-landing Salesforce projects; `fde-dev` for contract
  delivery to recruiters and hiring managers; `paperclip-dev` for running the business, the
  portfolio site and Home Services AI; `agency-dev` for client delivery; `rhce-dev` for Red Hat
  Linux administration; `oscp-dev` for OffSec Kali administration. No RHCE or OSCP
  certification is claimed. Full text: `AGENTS.md` in the private `hossainconsulting/vm-lab`
  repository, section "Mission, roles and lab allocation" (on a VM, `~/projects/vm-lab/AGENTS.md`
  once that change is merged and pulled).
- State only what the evidence supports. Never invent results, clients, contracts or
  certifications.
- Browser and credentials: never ask for, store or write passwords, tokens or cookies anywhere.
  Use only tabs Hemayet has already signed in. Stop at a login, 2FA or CAPTCHA. Emails, posts
  and applications are drafts until Hemayet approves each one. No payments or account changes
  without explicit approval.
- Open follow-ups for Codex are in `evidence/2026-10-07/connect-and-handoff/README.md` in the
  private `vm-lab` repository.
